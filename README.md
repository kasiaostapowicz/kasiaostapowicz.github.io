I am currently a researcher at <a href="https://www.nina.no/english/About-NINA/Contact/Employees/Employee-info?AnsattID=16669" target="_blank"><b>the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA)</b></a>. As a researcher specialized in remote sensing, land system science, and landscape ecology, my motivation centers on using technological advancements to tackle ecological challenges. With ecosystems playing a crucial role in climate regulation and biodiversity support, my work aims to bridge the gap in their effective monitoring, management, and restoration. This is particularly urgent in the face of rapid urbanization and environmental change, where my focus is on integrating remote sensing with ecological knowledge to better understand and safeguard terrestrial and marine ecosystems. My goal is to contribute to innovative, practical solutions for sustainable environmental management and policy-making. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research.

I am a researcher at [the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/Home). My research focuses on an understanding of coupled human-environmental systems. I am interested in the use of remote sensing and geoinformation methods in environmental change studies. I connect advance remote sensing methods from big data mining to machine learning with land system analysis. My current study regions are mountains and polar regions. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research.

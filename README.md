I am currently a researcher at <a href="https://www.nina.no/english/About-NINA/Contact/Employees/Employee-info?AnsattID=16669"><b>the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research NINA</b></a>, with an academic foundation in geography and physics. My research expertise lies at the intersection of remote sensing, geoinformatics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, land system science, and landscape ecology. I have a particular focus on the dynamic environments of mountainous and polar regions, where I investigate land covar and land use changes, climate change impacts, and vegetation shifts.

My work is deeply rooted in the principles of sustainable development and nature-based solutions, aligning closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I am dedicated to advancing climate action (SDG 13), preserving life on land (SDG 15), and fostering sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). As an ardent advocate for open science and reproducible research, I am committed to enhancing scientific understanding and promoting sustainable environmental practices.
								
In addition to my research pursuits, I am passionate about education and mentorship, guiding and inspiring the next generation of scientists in these crucial fields. My goal is to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future through rigorous research, innovative solutions, and dedicated teaching.

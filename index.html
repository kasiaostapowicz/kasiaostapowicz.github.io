                        <b>Dr Katarzyna Ostapowicz</b> is a research scientist working in Environmental Data Science and Earth Observation, with applications in Land System Science and biodiversity and climate research. Her work focuses on quantitative analysis of land-use and land-cover change, ecosystem dynamics and climate–ecosystem interactions across Arctic and temperate regions. She develops and applies spatial modelling frameworks integrating satellite time-series, geospatial analysis and GeoAI approaches to investigate long-term environmental change and ecosystem resilience. Her research combines methodological development with empirical case studies, contributing to improved understanding of biodiversity patterns, carbon dynamics and land-system transformations.

	<h1>Research projects</h1>
	<p>
	As Principal Investigator or a key contributing researcher, I have been actively engaged in a wide range of research initiatives aimed at understanding and monitoring environmental change, with a particular focus on land use and land cover dynamics within the framework of land system science. My work integrates remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and advanced methods such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to investigate the trajectories, drivers, and impacts of these changes across various spatial and temporal scales. A core aspect of my research involves the analysis of long-term environmental change, spanning the past 150 years, while also developing projections of future land cover scenarios. These efforts are grounded in specific geographic contexts, including Central Europe, mountainous regions, and fragile polar ecosystems. By utilizing both passive and active remote sensing technologies, my research addresses critical challenges such as vegetation health, phenology, and biodiversity loss, providing valuable insights into human-environment interactions and their consequences for sustainability. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of the research projects I have led or contributed to, highlighting their scientific innovations and broader impacts.

				<b>Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composites for Vegetation and Land Cover Monitoring</b>, 2025, Research Council of Norway (RCN), NINA basic funding, no. 160022/F40/25-34 (NINA, Norway)
        			<p>
            			The Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composites project aims to enhance vegetation and land cover monitoring in Norway by integrating high-resolution Sentinel-2 data with the long-term Landsat time series. This innovative approach seeks to improve differentiation of low biomass vegetation, such as lichen-dominated habitats, while ensuring temporal consistency and supporting broader ecological applications. Seasonal composites are being developed to capture key vegetative growth periods, offering improved accuracy for vegetation indices like NDVI and GRVI, which are critical for phenological monitoring and understanding carbon cycles. By leveraging advanced processing techniques and validating outputs with field data, the project is expected to provide actionable insights into vegetation dynamics, biodiversity assessments, and land cover changes. The integration of these datasets will safeguard continuity in long-term monitoring as MODIS nears the end of its operational life, supporting sustainable land management and ecosystem studies. The outcomes aim to establish a robust database and advance methodologies, setting a foundation for future research and ecological applications.

				<b>POLARSIF Project: Assessing Vegetation Phenological Changes in Polar Regions Using Solar Induced Fluorescence Data</b></br>
				Research Council of Norway (RCN), 2024, NINA basic funding, no. 160022/F40/24-17 (NINA, Norway)
        			<p>
            			The POLARSIF project examined vegetation phenological changes in Arctic regions, focusing on Svalbard from 2019 to 2023, using Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) data. By integrating ground-based measurements from the FloX spectrometer with satellite data from OCO-2 and Sentinel-5P, the project provided a comprehensive analysis of vegetation dynamics in response to rapid climate changes. POLARSIF leveraged advanced remote sensing techniques to assess greening and browning trends, correlating them with climatic variables such as temperature variations, snowmelt timing, and precipitation changes. This pioneering approach offered direct insights into photosynthetic activity, surpassing traditional indices like NDVI in accuracy and sensitivity, especially in polar environments. The projectâ€™s findings advanced understanding of Arctic vegetation resilience and adaptation under climate stress, setting new standards for monitoring and managing Arctic ecosystems.

				<b>TRACE project: Trajectories, causes and consequences of land cover and land use changes in Central Europe</b> </br>							National Science Centre Poland (NCN), 2019-2023, OPUS call, no. 2018/29/B/ST10/02979 (Jagiellonian University, Poland), contributing project to Global Land Programme
        			<p>
            			The TRACE project investigated the trajectories, drivers, and consequences of land cover and land use changes in Central Europe over the past 60 years. By integrating advanced remote sensing data from sources such as Landsat, Sentinel, and Corona missions, the project created detailed spatial databases capturing changes in land use patterns across Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. It focused on key processes, including agricultural land abandonment and peri-urban development, using ensemble modelling and telecoupling frameworks to analyse socio-economic, political, and environmental drivers. The project also assessed the impacts of land cover changes on biodiversity and carbon pools, employing innovative remote sensing methodologies to identify biodiversity indicators and evaluate carbon fluxes. The outcomes included comprehensive land cover maps, improved methods for modelling land use changes, and insights into the interplay between land dynamics and ecosystem services. TRACE contributed to advancing land system science by integrating sustainable development principles, aligning its findings with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those addressing climate action, life on land, and sustainable communities.

				<b>SOCPIX project: Socialising the pixel: detecting and a better understanding of changing land systems with remote sensing and social sciences</b></br> 
				Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA), 2019-2021, no. PPN/BEK/2018/1/00310 (University of California, Berkeley, USA)
        			<p>
 			The SOCPIX project integrated remote sensing with social science methods to understand land system changes and their drivers. Combining Earth Observation (EO) data, such as long-term Landsat and Sentinel time series, with socio-ecological datasets, it "socialized the pixel," linking satellite imagery to social, economic, and institutional processes. Key objectives included mapping land use intensification, displacement, and transitions across the Carpathians and Rocky Mountains. The project used the telecoupling framework to explore interactions between distant social-ecological systems, providing insights into land use dynamics. SOCPIX advanced Land System Science by developing integrated frameworks and methodologies, contributing to better land management strategies and understanding of human-environment interactions.

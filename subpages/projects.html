        			<p>
 			The SOCPIX project integrated remote sensing with social science methods to understand land system changes and their drivers. Combining Earth Observation (EO) data, such as long-term Landsat and Sentinel time series, with socio-ecological datasets, it "socialized the pixel," linking satellite imagery to social, economic, and institutional processes. Key objectives included mapping land use intensification, displacement, and transitions across the Carpathians and Rocky Mountains. The project used the telecoupling framework to explore interactions between distant social-ecological systems, providing insights into land use dynamics. SOCPIX advanced Land System Science by developing integrated frameworks and methodologies, contributing to better land management strategies and understanding of human-environment interactions.

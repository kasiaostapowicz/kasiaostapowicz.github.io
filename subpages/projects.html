        			<p>
 			The SOCPIX project integrated remote sensing with social science methods to understand land system changes and their drivers. Combining Earth Observation (EO) data, such as long-term Landsat and Sentinel time series, with socio-ecological datasets, it "socialized the pixel," linking satellite imagery to social, economic, and institutional processes. Key objectives included mapping land use intensification, displacement, and transitions across the Carpathians and Rocky Mountains. The project used the telecoupling framework to explore interactions between distant social-ecological systems, providing insights into land use dynamics. SOCPIX advanced Land System Science by developing integrated frameworks and methodologies, contributing to better land management strategies and understanding of human-environment interactions.

				<b>LIM project: Integration of categorical- and gradient-based approaches in landscape fragmentation and connectivity modelling using GIS&T</b></br> 
				SONATA call, National Science Centre Poland (NCN), 2012-2015, No.2011/03/D/ST10/05568 (Jagiellonian University, Poland)</br>
        			<p>
 			The LIM project developed advanced methodologies for analysing landscape connectivity and fragmentation by integrating discrete and gradient approaches within unified Landscape Integrated Models. The research focused on the impact of matrix representations (binary, categorical, and continuous) on connectivity assessments, combining habitat suitability and resistance surface analyses to identify critical movement corridors and barriers. These innovative methods were applied in the Carpathian Mountains to study large, protected mammals, including brown bears (Ursus arctos) and European bison (Bison bonasus), whose survival depends on well-connected habitats. The findings are vital for understanding and maintaining ecological networks, offering tools to improve conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes. While directly addressing the needs of Europe’s biodiversity hotspots, the project’s methodologies and insights have broader global applications, supporting habitat management and conservation planning for large mammals and other species reliant on functional connectivity.
